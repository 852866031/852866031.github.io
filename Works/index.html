<h3 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract:"></a>Abstract:</h3><p>Many modern workloads, such as neural networks, databases, and graph processing, are fundamentally memory-bound. For such workloads, the data movement between main memory and CPU cores imposes a significant overhead regarding both latency and energy. This is known as the <strong>data movement bottleneck</strong>.</p>
<p>To address this bottleneck, computer scientists have pursued the ideas of in-memory and near-memory computing for decades. Processing-in-memory (PIM) refers to a broad class of technologies that augment memory with computing capabilities: from embed- ding logic gates into the memory fabric to placing “conventional” processors close to memory. This brings computation closer to data, thus avoiding data movement between the memory and the processor which saturates the memory bandwidth. Research on PIM has spanned more than a decade, but few of the proposed designs have been built or made commercially available. Recently this has changed. UPMEM has just released a PIM-capable DRAM product. The purpose of our project is the virtualization of PIM-capable memory in order to allow its utilization in the cloud.</p>
<p>In our project, we used Firecracker developed by Amazon, coupled with KVM as the virtual machine monitor, and virtio, the virtualized I&#x2F;O specification to achieve vir- tualization. The goal is to expose one UPMEM PIM hardware to multiple users on multiple virtual machines. We adapted the split-driver approach.</p>

<h3 id="Abstract-1"><a href="#Abstract-1" class="headerlink" title="Abstract:"></a>Abstract:</h3><p>Previously we conducted a baseline study and benchmark on Time Series Database (TSDB) like InfluxDB and TimescaleDB and got to know the struc- tures and properties of databases. Our goal was to eventually deploy new storage technologies such as Persistent Memory (PMEM) in the TSDB to verify the impact of emerging storage technologies on reimagining the way data-intensive storage systems work. In this project, we explored multiple possibilities for adjusting the database and explored several Persistent Memory Development Kit (PMDK) libraries that can be used. A persistent memory cache is then implemented and added in TimescaleDB and PostgreSQL. We then benchmark the database with the original cache and PMEM cache running in parallel and analyze the performance of the database.</p>
<h3 id="Backgrounds"><a href="#Backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="Backgrounds:"></a>Backgrounds:</h3><p>The Intel® OptaneTM DC Persistent Memory Module (PMEM) is the first commercially available NVDIMM that creates a new tier between volatile DRAM and block-based storage. Persistent Memory is non-volatile, byte-addressable, low latency memory with densities greater than or equal to Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM). It is beneficial due to its potential to dramatically increase system performance and enable a fundamental change in computing architecture. Applications, middleware, and operating systems are no longer bound by file system overhead in order to run persistent transactions.</p>

<p>We have conducted a structure study and per- formance benchmark on 2 popular Time Series Databases: InfluxDB and TimescaleDB. We found that The speed of the same query varies greatly in the different databases. Also, the query rates are quite different between different types of queries in the same database. We decided to choose one database and apply persistent memory to it. InfluxDB is implemented in Go, while TimescaleDB is implemented in C. From the implementation perspective, we decided to go with TimescaleDB, as many libraries of PMDK support C language, which provides more flexibility in terms of programming.<br> <br />  <br />  <br /> </p>

<h3 id="Abstract-2"><a href="#Abstract-2" class="headerlink" title="Abstract:"></a>Abstract:</h3><p>The variable of time has become a crucial factor in the analysis and usage of data as it helps organizations for better understanding of the trends and patterns over time, eventually used in future prediction. Time Series data and Time Series Database (TSDB) are thus developed for optimized usage of the time feature. Solving the database bottleneck and improving system efficiency become crucial to make improvements. Motivated by solving the bottleneck of the Time Series Database, we conducted this research project to study the functionalities and properties of Time Series databases and to further compare their performance in insertion and various kinds of queries, in the end to choose the Time Series database best suited for our need. This project serves as a baseline and preparation work for our goal in eventually deploying new storage technologies such as Persistent Memory in the TSDB to verify the impact of emerging storage technologies on reimagining the way data-intensive storage systems work.</p>
